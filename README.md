# Results

Most riders appear to take their trips during commuting hours. However, this trend shifts on weekends, when most people use Citi Bikes during the middle of the day. New York City limits car traffic through the parks. This regulation may affect why riders opt to travel via bike.

Men take advantage of the subscription service more than women. However, customers of undefined gender pick up their use of picks on weekends. This may represent an untapped market for Citi Bike.
