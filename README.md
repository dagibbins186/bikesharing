# Overview
In 2013, New York City launched Citi Bike, bike share system that allows New Yorkers to make short trips by bike. This analysis looked at Citi Bike Data for the month of August 2019.
# Results
In August 2019, 2,344,224 users rented bikes. 1,900,359 riders (81%) chose to subscribe for rental services. Contrarily, about 1 out of every 5 riders opted for single-ride-services.

Most trips materialized during commuting hours. However, this trend shifted on weekends, when most people used Citi Bikes during the middle of the day. New York City limits car traffic through the parks. This regulation may affect why riders opt to travel via bike.
# Summary
Citi Bike's enterprise emerged successful in New York City. It offered an alternative to metro, taxi or walking. For multi-modal trips, users avoided parking, traffic and hassle. Men took advantage of the subscription service more than women. However, customers of undefined gender picke- up their use of bikes on weekends. This may represent an untapped market for Citi Bike. It is recommended other urban places incorporate Citi Bike based on New York's case study.
